# Wi-Fi Router and Access Point Troubleshooting

## 1. Power Cycle the Router/Access Point
- Turn off the router, wait 30 seconds, and turn it back on to resolve many connection issues.

## 2. Check Physical Connections
- Verify that all cables (power, Ethernet, etc.) are securely connected to the router.

## 3. Verify Router Lights
- Check the indicator lights on the router for any abnormalities. If the internet light is red or not lit, there may be an issue with your ISP or settings.

## 4. Change Wi-Fi Channel
- Switch to a less congested Wi-Fi channel to avoid interference from nearby networks.

## 5. Check for Interference
- Move your router away from other electronics that could cause interference, such as microwaves or cordless phones.

## 6. Update Firmware
- Ensure the router's firmware is up to date to prevent bugs or performance issues.

## 7. Reset the Router
- If all else fails, reset the router to its factory settings, but remember to reconfigure your Wi-Fi settings afterward.
