# Issue 1: Computer Takes a Long Time to Boot Up

## Problem:


Sarah's computer used to boot up within a minute, but now it takes over five minutes.

## Questions to Clarify:
- When did the long boot time start happening?
- Have you installed any new software or updates recently?
- Does the system hang at a specific point during booting (e.g., after the Windows logo)?
- How much free space is available on the system disk?

## Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Check Startup Programs:**
   - Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.
   - Go to the **Startup** tab and disable unnecessary programs.
2. **Run Disk Cleanup:**
   - Type "Disk Cleanup" in the Start menu, select the system drive, and clean up system files.
3. **Check for System File Corruption:**
   - Run `sfc /scannow` in an elevated Command Prompt to repair system files.
4. **Check Disk Health:**
   - Run `chkdsk /f` to check for disk errors.
